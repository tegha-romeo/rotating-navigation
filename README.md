# Rotating Navigation Animation

This project features a visually engaging rotating navigation menu built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main content smoothly rotates to reveal a hidden navigation sidebar when the menu button is activated. The effect is achieved through CSS transforms and transitions, while simple JavaScript handles the toggling of states.

## Features

- Animated rotating navigation menu
- Responsive layout and smooth transitions
- Accessible toggle buttons using Unicode icons (☰ for open, ✖ for close)
- Customizable content and imagery

## How It Works

The interface consists of a main content area and a circular button in the top left corner. Clicking the menu button (☰) rotates the main content and reveals a sidebar menu with navigation links. Clicking the close button (✖) rotates everything back to its original position, hiding the menu. All transitions are handled via CSS for a fluid user experience.
